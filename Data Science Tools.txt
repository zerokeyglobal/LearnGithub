For data integration / cleansing at a smaller scale, the python library pandas is often used. Please have a look at this notebook: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-with-python-using-pandas-library-c6f4a68ea8eb

If you want to already experience what clustering is, have a look at this: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/blob/master/2%20-%20KMeans.ipynb
